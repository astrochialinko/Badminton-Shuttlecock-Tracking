# INFO 521 - Final Project Proposal

## Brief Info
- **Topic**: Machine Learning in Badminton : Clasification of different badminton strokes during a match 
- **Authors**: Chia-Lin Ko, Yuan Jea Hew

## Research topic
Background :
- To classify badminton strokes performed by the players during a professional badminton match  
  - Badminton Strokes : Smashes, Drops, Clears, Drives, Net Shots, Lifts etc 
- Player Detection during match 
- Provide statistical analysis of players gameplay 
- Model :
  - Input data -> Video recording of a badminton match
  - Output -> Model prediction on badmionton strokes of players throughout the match (can be expanded to match analysis)  

Why it is important ?
- Helps efficiently analyze athletes performance and provide statistical insights of the match 
- To help improve and identify weak points in their gameplay
- These type of research work are not prevalent in the sport of badminton 

Knowledge gap (What we know/donâ€™t know about the topic)
- We don't know how well it can generalize into other video recordings outside of BWF footages

---
## Data Sets
A brief description of the data required :
  - Focusing on men and woman singles event in badminton tournaments
  - Snap shots of badminton players performing different kinds of strokes 
   
How would you get such data ?
- Video data to be extracted from Badminton World Federation (BWF) Youtube channel 
- Manually cut, trim, and label video data  

---
## Plans
A list of questions & corresponding analysis tasks you plan to do :
- Attempt to retrieve available public datasets (email authors etc) to cut down the time spent on labelling data
- Are we tested upon solely how well our model performs ? (Accuracy numbers, confusion matrix etc)
- Using models outside of the scope of our class ? (Computer vision, custom DL etc)
- Must it be real world application ?
- Implementing a paper ?
- Look for possible pretrained models
